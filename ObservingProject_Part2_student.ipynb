We will therefore do the compuation for the *B* and *V* filters and assume that the answers are similar as for the *g* and *r* filters.

In that case the background per pixel is 194.2 and 144.8 in the B and V band respectively in a 100 sec. exposure.  Every pixel in our detector has a random signal (or noise) that is introduced whenever the signal is read out from the detector.  This \"readnoise\" is 3.7 counts per pixel.
